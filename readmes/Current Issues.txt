parse_missions
* [FIXED] Cannot output the tower missions
* New events (ID:200XXX) have incorrect enemy outputs, they just count up from monster ID#1 onward repeatedly, even if that mission only has say, monsters #31-35
* For Ootakemaru (500288) lv11+ specifically, reads completely wrong enemies, also dunno why there's a random goblin in there when it never shows up ingame
* [CANTFIX] Cannot output the assault missions (workaround is in parse_missions_assault)
The assault missions are no longer available in the archive. I incorporated changes from the parse_missions_assault file, but can not test how it works 


unit
* [FIXED] 150 aff bonus not implemented with current formatting, also has 1.2x scaling when it shouldn't
* [FIXED] Plat heroes have incorrect max level and scaling
* [FIXED] Silvers are getting too many lines of stats, some error with the lv55 thing?
* [FIXED] Missing some new affection types like -cost
* [FIXED] Can't make pages for Akira's Fire/Sun tokens
* [FIXED] Doesn't seem to output attack speed anymore for some units and classes (Arge, Ambrose)
* [FIXED] Needs a way to translate affiliations
* [PARTIALLY] Summoner attack gifs are messed up without some manual input
Summoner sprites realy difficult to automate. Ideally you should blend summon and summoner sprites together in an image editor before creating an animation.
Currently it tries to generate gif of only the summoner animation, but it is still not correct for some summoners.
