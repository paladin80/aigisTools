parse_missions
* Cannot output the tower missions
* New events (ID:200XXX) have incorrect enemy outputs, they just count up from monster ID#1 onward repeatedly, even if that mission only has say, monsters #31-35
* For Ootakemaru (500288) lv11+ specifically, reads completely wrong enemies, also dunno why there's a random goblin in there when it never shows up ingame



unit
* [FIXED] 150 aff bonus not implemented with current formatting, also has 1.2x scaling when it shouldn't
* [FIXED] Plat heroes have incorrect max level and scaling
* [FIXED] Silvers are getting too many lines of stats, some error with the lv55 thing?
* Missing some new affection types like -cost
* Can't make pages for Akira's Fire/Sun tokens
* Doesn't seem to output attack speed anymore for some units and classes (Arge, Ambrose)

* Needs a way to translate affiliations
* Summoner attack gifs are messed up without some manual input
* Cannot output the assault missions (workaround is in parse_missions_assault)
